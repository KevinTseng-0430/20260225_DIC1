# Project Summary: Bo-Yan, Tseng Personal Web Page

## 🚀 Overview
Created a high-end, premium personal web page for **Bo-Yan, Tseng** featuring a modern dark-mode aesthetic and a real-time digital clock.

## 🛠️ Components & Features

### 1. UI/UX Design
- **Glassmorphism**: A sleek, translucent central card with a backdrop blur effect (`backdrop-filter`).
- **Dynamic Background**: An animated, multi-layered indigo and purple gradient glow that creates a "breathing" effect.
- **Modern Typography**: Integrated the **Outfit** font from Google Fonts for a clean, professional look.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop monitors.

### 2. Interactive Logic (`script.js`)
- **Real-time Clock**: A dynamic digital clock that updates every second to display the accurate local time and date.
- **3D Interactive Hover**: Implemented a mouse-tracking script that applies a subtle 3D tilt effect to the main card as the user moves their cursor.

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Uses CSS Variables for easy customization and keyframe animations for smooth transitions.
